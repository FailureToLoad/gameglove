## Keycap Angles

Refer to gameglove.h in the qmk folder for numbering. These are the keys in the last row, from left to right.

|   Key | Degrees |
|-------|---------|
| 42    | -8.6    |
| 43    | -4.3    |
| 44    | 90      |

## Case Materials

|  Layer | Material | Thickness     |
|-------:|----------|---------------|
| Switch | ABS      | 4.7mm         |
| Mid    | Acrylic  | 4.5mm         |
| Bottom | Acrylic  | 4.5mm         |

There was no logic behind using ABS for the plate, I was just browsing materials on [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/) and decided to try it. When using SendCutSend make sure to follow their guidelines on [CNC Routing](https://sendcutsend.com/cnc-guidelines/).

I know the space key looks... funky. The cutout takes into account the thickness of the switch place.
