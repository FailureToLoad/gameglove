# Game Glove

A minimal macropad for pc gaming. 

## Requirements

Having gotten tired of trying different keyboard layouts that all always felt slightly off, I set out to design a gaming peripheral with the following goals.

### Small footprint

This is a perpipheral that will sit along side my normal keyboard so it shouldn't be half the size of a 60% at most.

### Should be able to press the 2 and 3 keys with middle finger

Its muscle memory from WoW I've never been able to shake.

### Row aligned, column staggered, WASD oriented

Admittedly, I've never been able to hit keys like Z, X, and C reliably. My brain refuses to memorize the meat signals to reach down, then laterally. That led me to at least remove the lateral movement by going for something ortholinear-ish.

Pure ortholinear was uncomfortable for me, but column staggered ortho made a lot of sense. The problem is that most column staggered layouts base the spacing off of home-row hand positioning. This is for gaming, so the spacing should be oriented around WASD positioning.

### Modifier keys must be larger than 1u

From trying ortholinear, my hands felt fairly cramped with 1u modifier keys.

## Results

After a fair amount of iteration and prototyping, I've landed on the following.

### 4x5 + 4 Layout

I liked the look of 6 keys on the first row and row 5 felt just right at 3 keys.

### Row staggered first and last row

Row staggering the first row got me my 2/3 key situation I was looking for and the last row was positioned based off of where my thumb comfortably sits.

I cannot stree how much time I spent measuring the thumb positioning. It is maddening how many ways there are to do it wrong.

### WASD oriented

I shifted the spacing so that W is the highest point in the layout.

### Modifier key sizing

I changed the shift to be 1.75u to avoid non-standard sizing issues with keycap sets and then right-justified the modifiers to conform to the row-aligned, column-staggered requirement.
